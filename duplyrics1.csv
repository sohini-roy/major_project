Usher,There Goes My Baby,"There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out
When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea
I love the way that you be poking it out
Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

I get the chills whenever I see your face
And you in the place girl
Feel like I'm in a movie baby
I'm like oowee baby oh
Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste girl
No need to keep this baby
I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

And girl I feel like it's our first time
Everytime we get together
Baby loving you feels better than
Everything, anything
Put on my heart you don't need a ring
And I promise our time away won't change my love

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Girl, oh, I miss you
Baby, ever since that day you went away
I can't live without you
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind
If I don't see you today

With my white jacket on

Whitney Houston,My Love Is Your Love,"If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me

As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love

Austra,Spellwork,"Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion
Spellwork and lies!

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire",angry
Coro,Can't Let You Go,"I should have known you'd be this way
Serves me right, to fall in love

You brought me love then you took it back
We had it all and that's a fact
Love is a game that we all play
There's one thing I've got to say
I gave you my heart and I gave you my world
I spent those lonley nights right here in the cold
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long

Chorus:
Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside
Repeat (1x)

I can't help but think of how you made me feel
Everytime I think of the two of us
Can't realize
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Chorus (2x)

Can't let you go my love
You fit me like a glove
'Cause when you hold me tight
The feelings oh so right
Just can't foget those times
When you were mine, all mine
This love I have for you is true
So come back to the one who loves you

Can't let you go...
Can't let you go...

Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long...

I should have known that you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love
I can't help but think how you left me feeling
Everytime I think about the two of us
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it

New Direction,I Came To Jesus,"I was messed up, dirty as I could be,
I was on my way to hell
But I heard the preacher,
Preaching the Word of God,
Confess your sins and repent

I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, worn, and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord,
�how could He love me,
I have sinned against Your will�
But He said, �repent and I will forgive you,
The question's who will you serve?�

You might be dirty, messed up inside,
You may even have lost your will to live
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel,
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me

Weary

Afraid to cause yourself more pain
To face insanity

And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself

Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Where is my motivation
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will

But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it!
Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men.   *

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said,   Peace could last forever.  ?
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
An' I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land

And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

  We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials,
For example, to create a vacuum.
Then we fill that vacuum as popular war advances.
Peace is closer.   **

He recognized me,
And punched me in the nose, he said.
No more Mister Nice Guy,
No more Mister Clean,
No more Mister Nice Guy,
He said you're sick, you're obscene.

Bing Crosby,Sweet Leilani,"Sweet Leilani
Heavenly flower
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew
And then she placed them in a bower
It was the start of you

I dreamed of paradise for two
You are my paradise completed
You are my dream come true

Tropic skies are jealous as they shine
I think they're jealous of your blue eyes
Jealous because you're mine

Neil Young,Heart Of Gold,"I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions
I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood
I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
You keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

Whiskey bottles, and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you
Ooooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell
Ooooh that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink fool, will drown you
Ooooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell
Ooooh that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be all right come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you
Ooooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell
Ooooh that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Hey, you're a fool you
Stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before

One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix, Lord might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks
Ooooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell
Ooooh that smell
The smell of death surrounds you
Ooooh that smell
Can't you smell that smell

Guns N' Roses,Paradise City,"Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Just a' urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case
So buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Ragz to richez or so they say
Ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble
When it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' their time

Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Now he's a court jester with a broken heart

Turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losin' my mind�  Are you blind?

Runs the all, time loser,
Headlong to his death

Steam breaking on his brow

The train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
He sees his children jumping off
At stations, one by one
His woman and his best friend
In bed and having fun
He's crawling down the corridor
On his hands and knees
Old Charlie stole the handle and
The train it won't stop going
No way to slow down
He hears the silence howling
Catches angels as they fall
And the all-time winner
Has got him by the balls
He picks up Gideons Bible
Open at page one
