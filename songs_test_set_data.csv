77,Joan Jett & The Blackhearts,I Hate Myself For Loving You,"Midnight, gettin' uptight. Where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you.
Hey, Jack, It's a fact they're talkin' in town.
I turn my back and you're messin' around.
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown.
I think of you every night and day.
You took my heart, then you took my pride away.
I hate myself for loving you.
Can't break free from the the things that you do.
I want to walk but I run back to you, that's why
I hate myself for loving you.
Daylight, spent the night without you.
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do.
I won't be as angry 'bout the hell you put me through.
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right.
You just don't know what you was missin' last night.
I want to see your face and say forget it just from spite.
I hate myself for loving you .
Can't break free from the the things that you do.
I want to walk but I run back to you, that's why
I hate myself for loving you.
I hate myself for loving you.
Can't break free from the things that you do.
I want to walk but I run back to you, that's why
I hate myself for loving you.
I think of you every night and day.
You took my heart, then you took my pride away.
I hate myself for loving you.
Can't break free from the the things that you do.
I want to walk but I run back to you, that's why
I hate myself for loving you.
I hate myself for loving you.
I hate myself for loving you.",angry
36,Mavis Staples,You Are Not Alone,"You're not alone
I'm with you
I'm lonely too
What's that song
Can't be sung
By two?
A broken home
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
You're not alone
Every night
I stand in your place
Every tear
On every face
Tastes the same
A broken dream
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
An open hand
An open heart
There's no need to be afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I'm gonna get it through to you
You're not alone",sad
14,The Paris Sisters,I Love How You Love Me,"I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you I love how you miss me
I love the way you always treat me tenderly
But, darling, most of all I love how you love me

178,Building 429,I Believe ,"Walk blindly to the light and reach out for His hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
You will see that you and me we aren't very far apart

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe love will find a way
I believe love is the answer
I believe love will find a way

Violence has spread worldwide and there's families on the streets
We sell drugs to children now, well why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

I believe that love is the answer
I believe love will find a way
I believe love is the answer
I believe love will find a way

Walk blindly to the light and reach out for His hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand",happy

Can you see what I want?
I wanna run through your wicked garden
Heard that's the place to find you
Cause I'm alive
So alive now
I know the darkness blinds you

Can you see without eyes?

113,Three Days Grace,Home,"I�ll be coming home
Just to be alone
Cause I know you�re not there
And I know that you don�t care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try
You�re never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I�m better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you�re here
This is not my home
I think I�m better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

By the time you come home
I�m already stoned
You turn off the TV
And you scream at me
I can hardly wait
Till you get off my case

No matter how hard I try
You�re never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I�m better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you�re here
This is not my home

109,Hail The Villain,Take Back The Fear,"What I believe is all that I am
Take it away, I'm only a man
Back from the dead and now it appears
I'll be the one to take back the fear

Kill or be killed, that isn't me
Maybe it's you dying to be
Somebody else. Man of the year
But I am the one to take back the fear

(chorus)
Don't want anything taken away
(Someone, anyone)
Taken away from me
It's all that I believe

Message of hate, fading away
My love and my failures  one in the same
Now that I'm back, painfully clear
But I'll be the one to take back the fear

When it seems that everything was all a dream
Everything's not what it seems
Even I cannot believe in me easily",angry

Planting seeds of hate
I�ve loved, turned to hate

This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger
Misery
You�ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You�ll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You�ll find where murder lies

Infanticide

64,Black Sabbath,War Pigs,"Generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerer of death's construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning,
ashes where the bodies burning.
No more war pigs have the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.
Day of judgement, god is calling,
on their knees the war pigs crawling.
Begging mercy for their sins,
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!",angry

They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong,
Now, make it official and drink some of that Dom,

Create a world to keep you still

At first you cry and then you hate
Those people stole your will
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out

You might be full of doubt

'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
No nothing

Do you stain my brain?
My eyes are blurry
And I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name?
Do you breed my pain?
My heart is bloody
And I can't take it anymore
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself more pain
To face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see, your fear's your cage
You beg for help but you're alone
Stuck in a helpless rage
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
'Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
Do as you are told
